# 365-papers-in-365-days
The most valuable skill I developed during my four years of PhD was learning how to effectively read and analyze research papers. I progressed from taking a week to understand a single paper to being able to read one per day — a skill that can definitely be learned and improved with practice.

The papers I’ve read and discuss fall into several overlapping categories: **Distributed Systems**, **Programming Languages**, **Formal Methods**, **Verification**, and **Artificial Intelligence**.

I’ve included in this repository all the examples, counterexamples, and notes I created while reading these papers and making YouTube videos about them.

If you found this helpful, I’d love to hear from you! And if you have suggestions for improvements — things to add, remove, or change — please let me know as well.
